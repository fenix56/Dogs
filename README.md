# Dogs App
Simple iOS app using SwiftUI created by [me](https://github.com/fenix56) to demonstrate my software enginieering skills. 

## Description
**Dogs App** calls <https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all> API to show the list of most popular dog breeds around the world. 
On the start of app you should see this screen:
